# Pakistan Sign Language Recognition using Computer Vision

With 5% of any country's population experiencing hearing impairment, there is a crucial need for a national sign language interpreter. To address this, we've developed a PSL Interpreter that employs computer vision technology to convert sign language into text with just a camera. 
Built for our "Introduction to Computer Vision" course, under the supervision of Dr. Naeem Akhtar
